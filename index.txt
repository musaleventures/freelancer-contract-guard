Payment

The Client agrees to pay the Freelancer a fixed fee of $2 USD for all services rendered (Article 1(b), Article 2).

The Freelancer may invoice weekly (Article 7(d)).

The invoice payment period is left blank, meaning payment timing is undefined and should be clarified (Article 7(e)).

Taxes are not included in fees; each party is responsible for their own taxes (Article 7(b)).

Late payment terms are mentioned, but late fee details are not specified (Article 7(c)).

The method of payment is not defined, creating ambiguity (Article 7(a)).

Intellectual Property (IP)

All work product created by the Freelancer belongs to the Client (Article 10).

The Freelancer assigns all rights, title, and interest in the work to the Client, including copyrights, patents, and trademarks.

All eligible work is treated as “work made for hire” under U.S. Copyright law.

The Freelancer may use completed work in their portfolio only after the Client makes it public.

Termination

The agreement automatically terminates on a specified date, but the date is currently blank (Article 16).

Either party may terminate the agreement with written notice if:

There is a material breach not cured within 14 days, or

The other party is unable to perform duties, including payment (Article 16(a)–(b)).

There is no expectation of ongoing or additional work beyond this agreement.

Liability

The Freelancer warrants that:

Services will be performed with reasonable care and skill, and

Deliverables will not infringe third-party rights (Article 12).

The Freelancer is not liable for failure to perform due to force majeure events, such as natural disasters or acts beyond reasonable control (Article 17(j)).

There is no explicit limitation of liability or indemnity cap, which may increase Freelancer risk.

Non-Compete

No non-compete clause is included in this agreement.

The Freelancer is not restricted from working with other clients, provided confidentiality obligations are respected.

Clause: Payment

Risk Level: High
Why this matters:

The pay is only $2 total, which is extremely low.

The contract does not say when the client must pay or how they will pay.

If the client delays or doesn’t pay, there is no clear protection for you.

Clause: Intellectual Property (IP)

Risk Level: High
Why this matters:

Everything you create automatically belongs to the client, forever.

You cannot reuse or resell the work elsewhere.

You can only show the work in your portfolio after the client makes it public.

Clause: Termination

Risk Level: Medium
Why this matters:

Either side can end the contract if the other side fails to perform.

There is no clear notice period for normal termination.

The end date is blank, which can create confusion about when work truly ends.

Clause: Liability

Risk Level: Medium
Why this matters:

You promise that your work will not cause problems for anyone else.

If an issue comes up, the contract does not clearly limit your responsibility.

Some protection exists for disasters or events outside your control, which helps.

Clause: Non-compete

Risk Level: Low
Why this matters:

There is no non-compete clause in the contract.

You are free to work with other clients, including competitors.

You just must not share the client’s private information.

Clause: Payment

Current Risk: High

Total payment is $2

No clear payment deadline

No clear payment method

Safer Alternative:

“Client will pay Freelancer a total fee of $____, payable within 7 days of invoice. Payment will be made via bank transfer / UPI / PayPal. Late payments will include a reasonable late fee.”

When to use this:

Always use this before starting work

Especially important if the client is new or unknown

Use when you want certainty on how much, how, and when you get paid

Clause: Intellectual Property (IP)

Current Risk: High

Client owns everything, forever

Ownership applies even if you are not fully paid

Safer Alternative:

“Ownership of the final work transfers to the Client only after full payment is received. Freelancer keeps the right to reuse general skills, ideas, and non-confidential parts of the work for future projects and portfolio.”

When to use this:

When payment is not upfront

When the work is reusable (designs, templates, code, content)

When you want protection if the client stops paying

Clause: Termination

Current Risk: Medium

End date is missing

No clear notice for normal termination

Safer Alternative:

“Either party may end this agreement with 14 days’ written notice. Client will pay Freelancer for all work completed up to the termination date.”

When to use this:

For ongoing or multi-week projects

When scope or timeline is unclear

When you want to avoid unpaid work if the project suddenly ends

Clause: Liability

Current Risk: Medium

No clear limit on how much trouble you could face if something goes wrong

Safer Alternative:

“Freelancer’s responsibility is limited to the amount paid under this agreement. Freelancer is not responsible for indirect or unexpected losses.”

When to use this:

When working with businesses or large clients

When the work affects revenue, systems, or customers

When you want to avoid open-ended blame

Clause: Time for Performance (Deadlines)

Current Risk: Medium

Missing deadline = automatic breach

No flexibility for delays outside your control

Safer Alternative:

“Deadlines may be adjusted if delays are caused by missing inputs, late feedback, or events outside Freelancer’s control.”

When to use this:

When the client must provide content, feedback, or approvals

When the project depends on multiple people or tools

When timelines are tight or unclear

💡 Pro Tip for Negotiation

You don’t need to fight every clause.
A good approach is:

Firm on Payment & IP

Reasonable on Termination & Liability

Calm, practical language
